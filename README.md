# Quantitative Macroeconomics and Finance with Python

## Introduction

In this project, we select three tickers and regress them against Goyal-Welch macroeconomic data to generate a strategy that outperforms excess returns. To achieve this, we explore Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with ridge regression and Deep Neural Network models. By comparing traditional econometric methods with more modern machine learning models, we assess their effectiveness in improving risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratios).

## How to run

Each of the file is jupyter notebook file, each of them can be run with internal run all in notebook. Altrnatively, You can use 

```
    > python run_notebooks.py
``` 
For running all notebooks with optional paramter --pattern to run specific set.

## Theory and Report
